Before you begin you quest to discover and #utilise your scientific mind, you need to #learn information about the scientific make #up of everything inside this universe. #To do this you require a "scanner" (new name required) #By right clicking a block multiple times, #you will learn about the chemical structure #of the object. To learn and discover new #things, you will have to earn knowledge in #specific fields. On par with this, different #projects require different amounts of #knowledge; similarly to this different #projects require different blocks and items #to have been discovered. #Overall I wish you luck in gaining #scientific know-how, and becoming the #best scientist you can.
